After nearly six months of development, we hit a huge milestone — our audio system is working.

The system correctly announced our test audio channels: "Front Left... Front Right." It might sound simple, but getting here required an enormous amount of work across multiple systems.

Here's what we had to build to get to this point:

- Backend server infrastructure
- Hardware connectivity
- GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) functionality
- Audio system implementation (completed with contractor support)

Each of these components represents months of work, testing, and iteration. The audio piece was the one that had us stuck the longest, and bringing in a contractor to help push through the final hurdles was the right call.

This is one of those features that's so fundamental — without it, the product just wouldn't feel complete. Checking it off the list feels like a real turning point.

We're also excited to announce new merchandise under our Founder Series, with plans to transition merchandise operations to a dedicated website.
