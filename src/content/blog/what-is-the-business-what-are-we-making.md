We're always asked two questions when talking about Franklin Labs:

**What is the business?** And **what are you making?**

The short answer: Franklin Labs is an electronics manufacturer, SaaS seller, and a cloud hosting provider. We're building a communications platform, and our MVP is nearing completion.

The longer answer involves decades of experience with single-board computers, server management, Docker containers, and 3D printing. This isn't our first rodeo — it's just the first time we're turning all of that experience into a product for other people.

One thing worth noting: AI has been super useful as an assistant in accelerating our development processes. It's not doing the work for us, but it's helping us move faster and think through problems more efficiently.

We're not trying to be everything to everyone. We're building a specific tool for a specific need, and we're doing it the right way.
