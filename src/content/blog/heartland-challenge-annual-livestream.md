This past weekend we returned to Sports Park Raceway for our annual livestream of the Heartland Challenge — a 10-hour endurance ATV race that pushes both riders and technology to their limits.

For us, this event is more than just a production gig. It's an annual proving ground.

We managed the full computer network architecture with P2P wireless, multi-camera rigs, Starlink satellite internet, and a mobile production studio. Everything had to work in the field, in the heat, for 10+ hours straight.

This year was also the first time we revealed the product name publicly. The prototype was in the field, handling real-world conditions alongside our production setup.

Events like these are where we learn the most. The bench can only teach you so much — real dust, real heat, real connectivity challenges, and real stakes are what shape a product.
