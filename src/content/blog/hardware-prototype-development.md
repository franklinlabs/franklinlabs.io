One of the things that's made a real difference in our hardware development process is leveraging manufacturer-provided CAD models and 3D files.

Being able to drop native part files directly into our design workflow cuts hours of modeling, prevents misalignment, and lets us stay focused on function instead of guesswork.

This week we incorporated a connector model from Amphenol into an enclosure layout. Having the exact dimensions and mounting points available as a 3D model means we can validate fit before we ever print or machine anything.

It's a small thing that makes a huge difference — especially when you're working with tight tolerances and limited space.
