Building a product from scratch doesn't follow a straight line. That's something we've learned firsthand over the past several months.

We're nearly six months into development now. We've had two prototypes, one soft tested and one field tested. There have been two major design overhauls, and more iterations than I can count.

Every time we think we're close, something new comes up — a component that doesn't fit right, a feature that needs rethinking, or a real-world test that reveals something we missed on the bench.

But that's the process. Each setback teaches us something, and each version gets closer to what we're actually building toward.

We're working toward another field test phase — hopefully this time with some added features and two units in play.
