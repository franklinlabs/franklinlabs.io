When you're building hardware, your component access can dictate your momentum. That's something we deal with constantly.

Tariffs have had a real impact on how we source parts. In technology, it isn't as easy as pivoting to USA-made products — many components simply aren't manufactured domestically, and the ones that are often come at a premium that can make or break a startup's budget.

We use DigiKey as our primary supplier, and the reality of supply chain challenges affects everything from our timeline to our bill of materials.

It's not glamorous, but getting the right parts at the right time is a huge part of what makes product development work. Every order, every lead time, every back-ordered component shapes what we can build and when.

From wishlist to workbench — that's the real journey.
