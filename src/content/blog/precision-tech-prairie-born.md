We brought back the designer who helped us create our Founder Series merch — not to sell more shirts (though this would look pretty sweet on one), but to capture what we're building here.

Over the past year-plus, we've gone through seven case designs, multiple equipment orders, and countless code reviews. It's been intense, methodical, and deliberate.

We deliberately missed a major beta testing deadline because the product just wasn't ready, and we weren't going to compromise on that. We're not putting out something half-baked for our customers to troubleshoot.

Right now we're focused on building customer dashboards and strengthening our cloud backend infrastructure. We have four operational servers with a fifth planned for onboarding.

The tagline says it all: Precision Tech. Prairie Born.

That's not just a slogan — it's how we operate. Every decision, every iteration, every late night in the shop is about building something we're proud of.

*Precision Tech. Prairie Born.*
