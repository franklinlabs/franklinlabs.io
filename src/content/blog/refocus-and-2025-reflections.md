It's been a while since I've posted an update, and honestly, I need to refocus.

2025 marked the official start to owning a business. What seemed like a six-month in-house project expanded into something much bigger — a global collaboration that pushed us in ways we didn't expect.

The challenges were real:

- **Hardware design iterations** — more overhauls than we planned for
- **Burnout** — balancing family obligations and government work took its toll
- **Tariffs and economics** — 2025 brought increased costs from tariffs, which in technology isn't as easy as pivoting to USA-made products
- **Communication gaps** — working with mentors and collaborators remotely has its own learning curve

I'll be honest — there were times I questioned whether we could pull this off. The scope kept growing, deadlines kept moving, and the energy it takes to keep everything running is relentless.

But here's what I know: the product is better because we took the time. The team is stronger because we worked through the hard stuff. And the vision hasn't changed.

Goals for the coming year: better time management, better project management, and more realistic planning.
