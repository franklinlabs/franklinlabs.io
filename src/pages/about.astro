        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Franklin Labs was founded by Alan Franklin, a technologist with deep expertise in IT and project management. Our story traces back to early computing experiences with a Tandy 3000 and command-line systems — the kind of hands-on curiosity that never really goes away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, that curiosity evolved through single-board computers, custom hardware builds, server management, and 3D printing. Every project taught us something new, and every challenge pushed us to think differently about how technology should work in the real world.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in straightforward, resilient design rooted in Midwest principles. Our tagline — <strong>Precision Tech. Prairie Born.</strong> — reflects our commitment to practical problem-solving and small-batch innovation rather than trend-chasing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're engineers, makers, and parents. We know that meaningful innovations often emerge from unconventional spaces — garages, workshops, and late-night sessions after the kids are in bed. That's where the best ideas take shape.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Franklin Labs is dedicated to building precise, practical, and innovative tools grounded in prairie-born grit and guided by engineering expertise. We design hardware and digital solutions that help people create, experiment, and solve real-world challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're not here to reinvent the wheel — just to make a great product that people love.
