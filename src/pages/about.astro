            Franklin Labs is a Midwest-built blend of engineering grit, creative tech, and small-batch hardware innovation. Founded by a lifelong computer nerd turned project manager, our mission is to build tools and experiences that empower creators, field operators, and enthusiasts to take control of their signal, whether that means live-streaming a race, deploying a field camera, or just geeking out over a better workflow.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            With roots going back to a <strong class="text-text-primary">Tandy 3000, DOS command lines only</strong>, and late nights wiring up SBCs, Franklin Labs exists at the crossroads of old-school computing passion and modern digital craftsmanship. We're driven by curiosity, community, and the belief that the best things are often built in garages, home labs, and after bedtime.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
            We're not just another consumer tech brand. We're parents, engineers, creatives, and code-slingers, running between children's sports events, livestream switches, and side projects that accidentally became product lines.
